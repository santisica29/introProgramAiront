I learned git basics (branch, tags and commits, stash command and hooks).

First I've used this video course: https://learn.udacity.com/courses/ud123 <br>
Then i learned stash: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-stash-commands/ <br>
And git hooks with this link: https://githooks.com <br>
I've learn git push, pull and fetch with: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/
